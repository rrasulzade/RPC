Binder is implemented in C++ and compiled with "g++" (works on the student server).
Rpc is implemented in C and compiled with "gcc" (works on the student server).

The makefile is written for the GNU Make 3.81 (the version on the student server).

First of all run 'make' to compile binder.cc and generate RPC library.
Also, 'make binder' compiles binder.cpp separately.

Now, run ./binder, and copy BINDER_ADDRESS and BINDER_PORT which is used in other 
machines to connecting to the binder.

To compile client use:
gcc -L. -std=c99 client1.c -lrpc -pthread -o client
then run it with: ./client

To compile server use:
gcc -L. server_functions.c server_function_skels.c server.c -lrpc -lpthread -o server
then run it with: ./server

pthreads library is used for RPC library.
